A simple yet powerful quiz application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This app allows users to create quizzes, take quizzes with time constraints, and view their results. Designed to ensure fairness, only one user per email can access a particular quiz to prevent cheating.
